# OpenCV Playground

Welcome to my **OpenCV Playground!** This repository is a testing ground where I experiment with various projects using the OpenCV library.

## Dependencies:
- OpenCV 4.10

## Example Makefile:
If you want to try out my projects, check out the **Example Makefile** located in the `extras/` directory.

Make sure you modify the paths and flags according to the specific project requirements! OpenCV modules can be found [here](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/).
